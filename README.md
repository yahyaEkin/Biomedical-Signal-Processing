Noise reduction in ECG signals with LMS method using artificial ECG signals as reference signal.
<br> As a project for Biomedical Signal Processing Lecture, me and my teammate performed LMS adaptive signal processing algorithm to reduce noise in ECG signals with using artificially generated reference signals. We took clean ECG samples from MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database and compare the performance of different reference signals. To show the results, we tried to write a conference paper.
